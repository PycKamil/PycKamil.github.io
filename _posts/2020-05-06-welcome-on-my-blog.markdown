I never started blogging on something other than already set up Wordpress or other blogging platform since didn't want to commit seriously in web development. This time I checked out something different - [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) - which is static site generator. It's easy - took me about half on hour to start this site and it's supported by Github pages so my investment was minimal ðŸ‘Œ Let's see if I will have anythign interesing to share with iOS community ðŸ¤ž

Check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll-docs] for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll.
